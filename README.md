# Projet-CMI-PIX

Digital technology is becoming more and more present in our lives. To keep us informed, to work, to carry out administrative procedures, to travel, to share ideas, to communicate with our loved ones, etc., digital technology is becoming more and more present in our lives. For many people, digital technology is an opportunity, for others it is a risk that upsets our bearings and transforms our daily lives and jobs...

Pix is the new public service, created to meet this societal challenge. Its mission is to encourage each of us to cultivate our digital skills and value what we have acquired, throughout our lives.

As part of the CMI ISI programming project, we are going to propose several visualizations of data concerning the grades obtained by students in the first year of the science and technology college of the University of Bordeaux, class of 2018/2019.

Project is currently live at https://zeck.pythonanywhere.com
